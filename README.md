### Project Overview
The project specification is to create a responsive business landing page for a fictitious banking solution, Cache Bank, targeted at software developers. This project uses HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and JavaScript to build a functional and professional webpage. 

### Project Brief
I was tasked with creating a landing page that appeals to software developers, showcasing my ability to develop a professional and user-centric website. The landing page is meant to function across various devices and screen sizes, meaning that it should be responsive. All this was completed by following the guidelines and objectives outlined by the lecturers and coaches via prerecorded lessons.

### Elements included 
- HTML structure: to ensure the structure of the document aligns with the provided guidelines 
- CSS Tailwind: for all the styling elements that need to be included along with the structure
- Javascript functions: for all the interactive elements such as links and scripts
- Essential Web Page Sections: a navigation menu, contact section for developers to get a hold the bank, and footer section with all the socials.
- Responsive Design Elements: ensuring that the landing page is functional on mobile and desktop devices.
- Contact Methods: Include easy ways for potential employers or collaborators to contact the bank.


### Reflections 

# Areas of mastery 
HTML with its different semantic elements - I'm now comfortable enough to build, develop, and manipulate the structure of web pages and all HTML elements that deal with the layout and structure. 

# Challenges faced 
One of the main challenges I faced was following along with pre-recorded lessons that I could not interact with. Another major challenge I faced was the styling elements in component 4, which seemed to not align with the provided visual aids. I was able to overcome this issue by adding extra lines of code which were able to translate well when the code was run. Other challenges simply included network issues, recollection of work in different versions of the code, and keeping track of the many lines of code and using the proper indentation.

# Areas of Improvement 
An area of improvement that I would like to focus on, especially on future projects (which will require more), is to simply keep better track of all of my work. This can be accomplished by building the habit of commiting daily to my VCS and allowing that to keep track of all changes, edits, and versions that I would need to access. In terms of skills, an area of improvement that I see the need to address, is the various style elements that allow me to interact with, change, manipulate, and construct & deconstruct the objects I put inside the structure of my projects.

# Overall learning experience
My overall experience when it comes to the Capstone project is primarily positive, I learned many new things and was able to recieve validation in seeing that not only can I actively remember how to build code but also understand the minute intricacies that allow one to build freely. Although there were several moments where I faced challenges, I believe that I learnt from them and was able to increase my skillset in doing so.
